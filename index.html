	 			<h3>Last Known Whereabouts</h3>
	 			<p>The subspecies last existed in Cameroon, but an extensive survey in 2006 did not find any signs of living West African black rhinos. According to the IUCN, “it is highly probable that this subspecies is now extinct” thanks to increased poaching and demand for rhino horn.</p>
	 			<p>The western black rhinoceros was heavily hunted in the beginning of the 20th century, but the population rose in the 1930s after preservation actions were taken. As protection efforts declined over the years, so did the number of western black rhinos.</p>
